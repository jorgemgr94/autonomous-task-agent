# Autonomous Task Agent

This is a Python FastAPI project building an autonomous agent with reasoning, tool execution, and decision-making capabilities.

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.11+, FastAPI, Pydantic
- LangChain + LangChain-OpenAI
- Package management: uv

## Architecture

### Agent Flow
1. Receive task
2. Reason about required actions
3. Decide which tool to call (if any)
4. Execute tool
5. Observe result
6. Produce final response

### Design Principles
- No infinite loops
- Tools are explicit and validated
- Agent decisions are structured (JSON)
- Errors are handled gracefully

## Agent Rules
- Never hallucinate tool results
- If insufficient information is available, request clarification
- Tool calls must use structured schemas
- Reasoning should be logged but not exposed to end users

## Git
- Use conventional commits: `type(scope): description`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Keep subject line under 50 characters
- Use imperative mood ("add" not "added")
